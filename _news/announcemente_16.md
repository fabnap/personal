title:  First 2025 stable beams at the LHC as DAQ shifter
related_posts: false
---

Today I was at the DAQ (data acquisition) desk in the CMS new control room for the first stable beams of 2025. It was a great experience to be part of the team that ensures the smooth operation of the data acquisition system during this critical phase. The atmosphere was electric as we prepared for the first collisions of the year, and I was thrilled to witness the excitement and dedication of my colleagues.

All eyes on the event display, and the first events were recorded successfully. It is an incredible moment, trying to guess what kind of process originated the events on the screen.

The DAQ shifter has a crucial role in ensuring that the data acquisition system is functioning correctly and that the experiment is ready to record data. This involves monitoring the system's performance, troubleshooting any issues that arise, and coordinating with other teams to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Additionally, the DAQ shifter manages the start and stop of the runs, ensuring that the data is collected in a timely and efficient manner.
