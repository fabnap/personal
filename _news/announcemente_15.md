Today I'm introducing particle physics and the Standard Model to a group of high school students from the cities Orvieto and Perugia, within the International Masterclass initiative [link](https://agenda.infn.it/event/44900/).  It's a great opportunity to share my passion for physics and inspire the next generation of scientists. I'm looking forward to engaging discussions and hopefully sparking some interest in the field!
