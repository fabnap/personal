I'm very excited to share that today I start with a new faculty position of non-tenured Assistant Professor (Fixed-time researcher, RTDa) at the University of Perugia, in the Department of Physics and Geology. I will be (mainly) working with the CMS collaboration, focusing on the development of (quantum) machine learning algorithms for the analysis of data from the LHC, particularly targeting boosted topologies.

The Department of Physics and Geology at the University of Perugia is a vibrant and dynamic research environment, with a strong focus on experimental and theoretical physics. The department has a long-standing tradition of excellence in research and teaching (achieving the seal of excellence of the Italian Ministry of University and Research) and I am thrilled to be part of this community.
