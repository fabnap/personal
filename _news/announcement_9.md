ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Arrived to KrakÃ³w, Poland, for the 5th Jagiellonian Symposium on Advances in Particles physics and Medicine. I will give a talk on Kaonic Atoms with the SIDDHARTA-2 experiment. The [program](https://indico.koza.if.uj.edu.pl/event/15/timetable/?view=standard) is very interesting, with a lot of talks on the latest results in particle physics and medical applications. I am looking forward to it! I was asked and am honored to serve as char in the "Artificial Intelligence for Medicine" on Friday!
