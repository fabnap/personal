Just wrapped up our ALPACA workshop at ECT\*, Trento, focusing on modern algorithms in machine learning and data analysis, from medical physics to research with accelerators and in underground laboratories.
A big thank to our sponsors, the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT\*-FBK) and the Horizon EU programme EURO-LABS.
I want also to thank my co-organizers, Fabrizio Grosa, Raffaele Del Grande and Magdalena Skurzok and all the speakers, especially the hands-on organizers. It's been a rich week filled with new and exciting ideas across various domains. Check out the event details [here](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/184/timetable/?view=standard).
