Very proud to share that my project "QuEST (Quantum Experiment and Simulation Theory)" has been selected for funding by the Fondo di Ricerca di Ateno 2025 of the University of Perugia. Many thanks to the participants of the project for the support and collaboration! We will push forward the development of quantum machine learning and quantum simulations for HEP.
