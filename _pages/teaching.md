Here I will list some useful information for present and prospective students. 
We welcome both Bachelor/Master and PhD students.

### Thesis and Stage opportunities at INFN's Frascati National Laboratories

Take a quiz:

- Are you interested in studying the founding principles of quantum mechanics?
- Do you want to know more about quantum chromodynamics and exotic atoms?
- Want to make a difference in a real world-class experiment with your ideas and creativity?
- Are you looking for an experimental thesis to conclude your bachelor/master?
- Or perhaps a stage to further improve?

Then get in touch!

We always look for new students for thesis and internships.
Take the opportunity to participate to INFN experiments:

The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment explores QCD at low energies in the strangeness sector at the DAFNE accelerator. The detector will start data taking in spring 2021, aiming at performing the most precise measurement of atomic transition in kaonic deuterium atoms, which are exotic system composed of a strange meson, the kaon, and deuterium nucleus.

The VIP-2 experiment is a detector located at the Gran Sasso national laboratories (LNGS), looking for a tiny violation of the Pauli exclusion principle, which could happen in quantum gravity scenarios. Moreover the high sensitivity of the detector allows investigating wave-function collapse models. 

Both experiments are international collaborations, you will have the chance to be supervised by leading experts in the field, with decades long experience.
