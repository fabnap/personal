**Short Bio.** I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at the [Frascati National Laboratories](https://w3.lnf.infn.it/) of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics **INFN**.

I received my PhD degree in Particle Physics at the Heidelberg Universität, Germany, *magna cum laude*, with a thesis on a search for Dark Matter with the ATLAS detector at LHC, advised by [Prof. Oleg Brandt](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-oleg-brandt) (University of Cambridge).

During my PhD I worked with the [Kirchhoff-Institut Für Physik](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/atlas/) and was founded by the [International Max Planck Research School on Fundamental Symmetries](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/imprs-ptfs/); I spent over a year at [CERN](https://home.cern/) working on the first level trigger.

Got my Master in Physics at the Heidelberg Universität, and my Bachelor at the Tor Vergata University of Rome.

My main interests are **Machine Learning** (ML) and **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) in physics, foundation of **quantum mechanics** and exotic kaonic system at particle **colliders**.

I have started within my group a series of studies in ML and AI applied to X-Ray spectroscopy, see e.g. *[Measurement Science and Technology](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ad080a/meta)* where I constructed a deep neural network approach and *[Condensed Matter](https://www.mdpi.com/2410-3896/9/2/26)* where I developed a Differentiable Programming approach.

I am member of the SIDDHARTA-2 Collaboration, which studies the fascinating world of kaonic elements, exotic atoms where the kaons form a bounded state.
SIDDHARTA-2 at the DAFNE accelerator, is right now performing precision measurements of the property of kaonic systems, providing a more profound understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies.

I am also participating in the VIP-2 Experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratories. In the cosmic silence, protected from kilometers of rocks, VIP-2 looks for tiny violations of fundamental symmetries, which show up in atomic physics as the well known Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP).

Within the VIP Collaboration, we are looking for deviation to the standard quantum theory in the wavefunction collapse, and connecting the dots to a class of quantum gravity theories called Non-Commutative Quantum Gravity (NCQG).

I am author of over 300 peer-reviewed articles, with a h-index of 92
