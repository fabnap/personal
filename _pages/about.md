I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Frascati National Laboratories](https://w3.lnf.infn.it/) of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics.
My main interests are Machine Learning in physics, foundation of quantum mechanics and exotic kaonic system.

I am member of the SIDDHARTA-2 Collaboration, which studies the fascinating world of kaonic elements, exotic atoms where the kaons form a bounded state.
SIDDHARTA-2 at the DAFNE accelerator, is right now performing precision measurements of the property of kaonic systems, providing a more profound understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies.

I am also participating to the VIP-2 Experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratories. In the cosmic silence, protected from kilometres of rocks, VIP-2 looks for tiny violations of fundamental symmetries, which show up in atomic physics as the well known Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP).

Within the VIP Collaboration, we are looking for deviation to the standard quantum theory in the wavefunction collapse, and connecting the dots to a class of quantum gravity theories called Non-Commutative Quantum Gravity (NCQG).

I am author of over 300 peer-reviewed articles, with an h-index of 92
