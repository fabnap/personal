I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Frascati National Laboratories](https://w3.lnf.infn.it/) of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics.
My main interests are Machine Learning in physics, foundation of quantum mechanics and exotic kaonic system.
I am a member of the SIDDHARTA-2 collaboration, which is right now in data taking in Frascati aiming for the first ever measurement of kaonic deuterium, and
of the VIP collaboration, testing the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the Wavefunction Collapse in the cosmic silence of the Gran Sasso National Laboratory.
