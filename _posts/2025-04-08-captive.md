I just smashed my head against the wall for the n-th time trying to get a captive portal to work on my computer/smartphone.
Every time I connect to a network which requires a captive portal, I spend good half an hour trying to figure out why the login browser disappear and how to get it back. 
Since I am right now waiting for CERN's server to refresh configuration and allowing me to connect to the network, I thought I would write down a few tips on how to get captive portals to work.

### What is a captive portal?
A captive portal is a web page that is displayed to newly connected users before they are granted broader access to network resources.
It is often used in public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in airports, hotels, and coffee shops, to present terms of service or to require users to log in or pay for access.

### How to get captive portals to work?

Just connect to one of these links:

neverssl.com

There are more! So far these are fine.
Cheers
