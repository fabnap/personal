Ever felt like python's pip package is unnecessarily slow? Also using venv is a bit of a hassle, right? Then [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is the solution for you. It is a new package manager for python that is faster than pip (it is written in Rust) and has a lot of other features. 
Minimal guide to get started with uv:

```bash
python3.11 -m pip install uv # or your python version

uv init . # initialize this directory

uv python pin 3.11 # change preferred python version

uv add jetimage-processor # add package
uv pip freeze # check packages

# run stuff 
uv run main.py
uv run myscript 
```

Whatever you run with uv will be run in a virtual environment, so you don't have to worry about that.
You can also use uv to run scripts, and it will automatically create a virtual environment for you.

I think for me this is a game changer, and I will use it from now on.
I hope you find it useful too!
