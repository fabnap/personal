Just wanted to make a short post on this situation which had me annoyed for a long time. 
Sometimes you are browsing the web and you find a pdf file you want to read, but you don't want to download it (for me it's like 90% of the time). If I wanted it downloaded then I would have clicked on the download button, right?
Now Firefox (which is my browser of choice) has a built-in pdf viewer, which works great.

Some websites, however, have a script that forces the download of the pdf file, which is annoying. I saw that associated most of the times to php pages that serve the pdf file; in the end I got tired of manually deleting the download from the download folder, so I looked for a solution.

Luckily I found a nice add-on for Firefox that does the trick: [No PDF Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/no-pdf-download/); but I think all other browsers have similar add-ons.

Thank me later, and happy browsing!
