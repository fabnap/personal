Want to share a nice project which I have been working on in the last years: a telegram bot to monitor the status of the SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DAFNE accelerator. 

The bot is able to send messages to a telegram group, to a single user, and to send images and plots. The bot is also able to receive commands from the users and to send the data to a database. It is written in Python and uses the python-telegram-bot library. 

It was used by tens of shifters from different countries over the course of few years, and with it the reaction time was noticeably increased.

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/fabnap/telegram_bot_monitor).
