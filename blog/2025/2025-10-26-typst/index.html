<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Today I want to introduce you to my brief experience with Typst, a modern typesetting system that aims to be a more user-friendly alternative to LaTeX. As someone who has used LaTeX extensively for academic writing and document preparation, I was intrigued by Typstâ€™s promise of simplicity and ease of use. Actually I started using Typst for preparing some lecture notes and some proposal documents; mind you that many journals and conferences still require LaTeX submissions, so Typst is not yet a full replacement for LaTeX in all scenarios.</p> <p>There are few really positive aspects of Typst that I found particularly appealing:</p> <ul> <li>the markdown-like syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use, even for those who are not familiar with LaTeX;</li> <li>the incredible speed of compilation: Typst compiles documents almost instantaneously, which is a significant improvement over LaTeX, especially for large documents; if you have ever used Overleaf, you know how slow the compilation can be sometimes;</li> <li>the easiness of including packages and libraries: Typst has a built-in package manager that makes it easy to include additional functionality in your documents;</li> <li>the smallness of the installation: Typst is a lightweight application that can be installed quickly and easily on any system.</li> </ul> <p>I leave you to judge by yourself if Typst is a good alternative to LaTeX for your needs. For me for the moment it is rather a complement than a replacement, especially for quick documents and notes.</p> <p>Here are some useful links to get started with Typst:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://typst.app/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Official Typst website</a></li> <li><a href="https://typst.app/docs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Typst documentation</a></li> <li><a href="https://typst.app/docs/guides/for-latex-users/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Typst guide for LaTeX users</a></li> </ul> <p>Installation on MacOS is straightforward using Homebrew: ```brew install typst</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Actually you can also download the executable, move it to your `usr/local/bin` folder (and mark is safe for Mac with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine typst`) and BOOM, you are good to go with `typst compile myfile.typ`.

Here is a simple example of Typst code to create a document with a title, section, and some text:
```typst
= My First Typst Document
# Introduction
This is my first document created with Typst. It is easy to use and has a simple syntax.
